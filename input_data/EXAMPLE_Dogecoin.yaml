  This is the longest info text from all the examples. It has no valuable information, serves no
  other purpose, than to see, how line limitation works in html. To achieve the line limitation,
  webkit-line-clamp is used. I don't know, if it's the best way to do it, but hopefully it will
  work well, and I won't have to spend more time on it. As the readers might see, one could put
  quite a lot of information in this section, without it being clamped. Hopefully, this will be
  enough soon, as when writing this I'm starting to lose the creativity, needed to continue this
  inane text. However, I'm quite certain, that if someone's going to view this on 4k monitor, this
  sentense will still be visible, and I should continue writing this horrible test essay. One might
  say, that I could achieve the same effect by copying Lorem Ipsum, or whatever it's called, but
  where's the fun in that? If you're still reading this nonsense, I would advise you to rethink
  your life choices, and maybe start reading a book or even some dumb magazine, you would get much
  more from that, rather than this text. One more think I would like to check, if tooltips showing
  the full text are implemented by default, or will I have to do that myself. That's it.
